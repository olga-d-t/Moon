bio:                I dance, I tell stories, I explore and travel. One needn't go far, to find another world. 
description:        "My name is Olga Tsyganova. I was born in St.Petersburg, Russia. When I was 3 my family moved to the U.S. and at 15 we came back to Russia. Trying to adapt to the new culture, I pushed away my American upbringing, until I visited a storytelling workshop. I realized stories of confusion and difficulty can and must be told and itâ€™s freeing and provides beautiful ground for connection between people and to yourself. Now I am integrating the two cultures in me, exploring the world and seeking to continue sharing and hearing stories. My interests lie in physical theater, contemporary dance, Butoh, voice work."
